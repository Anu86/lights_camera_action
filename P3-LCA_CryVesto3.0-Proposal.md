For Project 3, team Cryvesto 3.0 seeks to address funding through the blockchain and smartcontract for a multi-media company "Light-Camera-Action"(LCA) to produce movies; educational material in the multi-verse; AR & VR platforms for theme centered fan entertainment of their favorite characters. Our goal is to provide investment opportunities to financiers and retail fans globally using smart contracts on the blockchain to defragmatize the global entertainment industry. 

Our approach to the global entertainment market place is to provide an opportunity for retail investors and fans to participate in investing in their favorite entertainment themes globally. The primary funding of LCA is from CryVesto PE with High-Net-Worth individuals through securitized smart contracts on the blockchain and retail investors for secondary round of funding for their preferred entertainment projects. In this way we can raise funds globally for market participants in which the entertainment production is produced. 

Attracting greater participation from regional participants to invest in their favorite theme and receive future returns is in the form of 'Bollycoins' from their favorite entertainment production royalties. In this way, it allows greater interaction between the studios, entertainers and fans to benefit from the financial returns of each production and enjoy the LCA entertainment ecosystem.  

We believe that utilzing blockchain technology and smart contracts in producing 'Bollycoin' tokens allows greater particpation for CryVesto PE firm to raise funds from a broad audience from HNW clients to interested fans at large globally. In this way we defragmentize the entertainment industry that is currently culturally isolated in its respective teritorial markets to a more inclusive global intercultural entertainment company.
